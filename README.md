The notebook includes a Class for Bootstrapping the prediction of a sk-learn classification model. 
It has the usual sk-learn methods (fit, predict), as well as a plot_predict method, which is used to visualize prediction CIs.

All methods are (hopefully) well documented, and an example is also supplied within the notebook.

Please don't hesistate to leave comments or suggestions. We hope it'll be useful for someone!
